# Glossary (IX-Vibe)

- **FRF (Frequency Response Function):** relationship between input excitation and output response across frequency (used to identify resonance peaks).
- **SRS (Shock Response Spectrum):** representation of how a shock event would excite a family of single-degree-of-freedom oscillators; used to assess shock severity vs frequency.
- **Random vibration:** broadband vibration environment typically characterized by PSD (power spectral density).
- **Acoustic forcing:** pressure fluctuations that drive structural response (especially panels and bays).
- **Resonance / mode:** a natural vibration pattern of a structure at a particular frequency.
- **Transmissibility:** ratio of response at a point to the input excitation.
- **Damping ratio (ζ):** measure of how quickly oscillations decay; higher ζ generally means lower resonance amplification.
- **CLD (Constrained Layer Damping):** a viscoelastic layer constrained by a stiff layer to convert vibration energy into heat.
- **STF (Shear-Thickening Fluid):** fluid that increases apparent viscosity under high shear; can increase energy dissipation in engineered geometries.
- **TMD (Tuned Mass Damper):** a mass-spring-damper tuned to reduce response at a target frequency.
- **Shunt damping:** piezoelectric damping approach using an electrical circuit to dissipate mechanical energy.

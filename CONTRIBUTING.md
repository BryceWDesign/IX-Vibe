# Contributing to IX-Vibe

## Core rule: auditability
Contributions must preserve a strict “engineer-auditable” standard:
- Claims must be tied to test data, references, or clearly labeled hypotheses
- Limits and failure modes must be stated explicitly
- Changes should include rationale and impact on success metrics

## What we accept
- Improvements to test procedures, measurement scripts, or documentation clarity
- Better failure-mode analysis and integration constraints
- BOM refinement with traceable sourcing notes
- Additional validation paths that reduce ambiguity

## What we do not accept
- Hype language (“zero vibration,” “guaranteed,” “magic cancellation”)
- Unverifiable claims without data
- Unsafe build steps or ambiguous procedures

## How to contribute
1) Open an issue describing the change and why it matters to success metrics
2) Keep commits small and focused
3) Include before/after notes for any procedure or script changes
